1. Make sure you have access to gaussview (otherwise 3/4 of these are useless)
2. Make sure you have a python executable with ASE installed
3. Put all these files in whatever directory
4. Locate that exe and use it to replace the "C:\Users\User\anaconda3\\envs\Musgrave_scripts\python.exe" in the .bat files
5. Replace the references to the python scripts (ie "C:\Users\User\...\center_z_com.py") so that they refer to the correct directory (where you put the right_click_scripts files)
7. Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog box
    (or `Option + R`)
    (The right combo should cause a "run" window to pop up)
8. Type `regedit` into the dialog box and press enter
9. Navigate to `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell`
10. For each .bat file, perform the following:
    10.a. Right click `shell`, click `New -> Key`
    10.b. Name the key after the .bat file (this is just the name that will show up on the right click menu)
    10.c. Right click on the key you just created and click `New -> key`, and name this new key `command`
    10.d. Double click the `(Default)` key within your new `command`, and in the `Value data` dialog box, paste the path
          to the .bat file inside quotation marks, a space, and then `"%1"` (also in quotation marks) and then hit `Ok`
          ie:  "C:\Users\User\PycharmProjects\Musgrave_scripts\BenRich\right_click_scripts\center_z_com.bat" "%1"


DEBUG NOTES:
    - Your python.exe may appear to be named just "python" (as the .exe extension is hidden by default on windows)
    - Make sure your regedit command references the .bat file, not the .py file
